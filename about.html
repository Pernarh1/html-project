        <h3>My Thoughts on Systems Engineering</h3>
        <p>Being an engineer entails using scientific and mathematical knowledge to design, construct, and enhance
            technology for the betterment of society. As problem solvers, engineers are accountable for creating and
            upholding structures, systems, and machinery that enhance our lives. To become an engineer, one needs to
            have a deep-seated interest in how things function, an aptitude for critical analysis, and a creative
            approach towards finding solutions for intricate problems. Engineers should always be aware of the latest
            technological advancements in their respective fields and strive to expand their knowledge continually. In
            addition to that, engineers must be aware of their social and environmental responsibilities, ensuring that
            their work is ethical, sustainable, and safe for the people and the planet. In essence, being an engineer is
            all about utilizing knowledge, skills, and innovation to resolve problems and foster positive change in
            society. This profession necessitates a never-ending pursuit of excellence, innovation, and ethical
